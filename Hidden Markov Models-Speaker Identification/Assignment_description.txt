2 - Speaker identification

There are three people in a room. Each says about 10 phonemes, before being randomly interrupted by someone else. When they speak they all sound the same, however each person tends to use different phonemes in their speech. Specifically we can model the following transition probabilities that someone will interrupt the current speaker: P(speaker i at time t+1 | speaker j at time t). We can also model the probability over phonemes given a particular speaker: P(phoneme | speaker i). The phonemes are identical to the ones introduced in problem 1 (but the transition matrices are obviously different, since they take a different form altogether).

Write down the update equations that you will need to train a hidden Markov model. Using the information given above, write down a sensible initialization for the transition matrix.

Write your own python code to train a hidden Markov model on the data. You may look at code online, but will need to reference any code that helps you with your implementation.

From matplotlb use a stackplot (https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.stackplot.html) to show the probability of a particular person speaking.
