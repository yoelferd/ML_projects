Book reviews and how to fake them

Find an interesting public domain book (https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top#books-last30) and download it as plain text.

Use Python to massage the data into a suitable format for processing by the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model contained in Scikit.learn. This will include removing stop words and punctuation.

Break the book up into small sections. The most appropriate level might vary between books, but you will most likely be breaking the book up into either paragraphs or chapters. (This might also be a pragmatic decision based on whateverâ€™s easiest.)

Train an LDA model on the corpus. The LDA model should find interesting topics that occur at the paragraph (or chapter) level. Be sure to explain your choice of parameters for any parameters that might have a significant effect on the model results.

Print out the first ten words of the ten most common topics.

Now write a single paragraph on the themes contained in the book!

Please convert everything to a single PDF file and submit it. Be sure to include all the code necessary to reproduce your results, but please leave out exploratory code that does not contribute to any figures or final results. This assignment is not just about code, and any choices which need justification, or insights you gain should be included in plain English.

Note: The problems are intended in a humorous way, and not intended to encourage actual dishonesty!
