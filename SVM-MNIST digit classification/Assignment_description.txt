Load the entire MNIST digit dataset: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. You will probably find the following code useful:
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_mldata\ mnist = fetch_mldata('MNIST original')

Choose two digit classes (e.g 7s and 3s) from the training data, and plot some of the examples.

Train a support vector classifier using each of the following kernels:

Linear

Poly

RBF

(If you encounter any issues with training time or memory issues, then you may use a reduced dataset, but carefully detail how you reduced the dataset.)

Report your training times on the dataset for the different kernels.

Report your error rates on the testing dataset for the different kernels.
