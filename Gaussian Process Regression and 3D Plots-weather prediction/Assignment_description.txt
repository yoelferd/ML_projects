Yosemite Village yearly weather

This weekâ€™s assignment revisits the temperature data from Yosemite Village. This data covers 6 years, so split the data into a training set of the first 5 years, and a testing set of the 6th year.

Using a sparse Gaussian process, estimate the temperature over time of day (0:00-23:59) and time of year (1-365). Describe in detail the covariance function you chose, and why. Did you fit any hyperparameters, and if so, how?

Measure the mean squared error (MSE) of your Gaussian process regression, and contrast it with the MSE of your linear parameter model from a few weeks earlier. Compare and contrast the training time of your linear parameter model with the training time of the Gaussian process model.

Make a 3D plot showing temperature as a function of (day, time). A contour plot is also acceptable (instead of a true 3D plot).
