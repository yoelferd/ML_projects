Fraud: A how-to guide

Many cases of fraud can be detected through outlier detection or other statistical analysis. A fairly well example is Benford’s law: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BenfordsLaw.html. This states that transactions amounts span several orders of magnitude and are best modeled in log-space. However when converted back into normal amounts, roughly 30% of the transactions will have an initial digit of “1”, and 17% will have an initial digit of “2” etc. This is very different from most people’s intuition that each digit should have an equal probability of occurring.

In this problem, you will use density modeling to try and ensure that there are no statistical irregularities in data that you have generated yourself.

Download the following data containing personal transactions over a period of several years: https://course-resources.minerva.kgi.edu/uploaded_files/mke/Y5GZpr/anonymized.csv

Now build the following density models for:

the number of transactions that occur in a single month.

the day in the month that a transaction will occur on.

transaction size.

Create plots showing the distributions that you’ve created.

Sampling from these density models, create a fictitious month of personal transactions.

Explain what flaws still remain in your model that a forensic accountant might be able to find and determine that this was a fraudulent set of transactions.

(Optional) How well does the data follow Benford’s law?
